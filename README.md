# Sample Assignment

## 📋 Overview
This assignment requires you to implement functions to calculate sine and cosine values using Taylor series expansion.

## ⚠️ IMPORTANT INSTRUCTIONS

### ✅ What You Should Do
- **Edit ONLY the `Q1.py` file** to implement your solution
- Implement the following functions:
  - `factorial(n)` - Calculate factorial of a number
  - `calculateSine(degrees, accuracy)` - Calculate sine values
  - `calculateCos(degrees, accuracy)` - Calculate cosine values
- Test your code locally before pushing
- Commit and push your changes to trigger autograding

### ❌ What You Should NOT Do
- **DO NOT edit `test_sineAndCosine.py`** - This file contains autograding tests

> **⚠️ WARNING:** Modifying test files will result in:
> - **Zero marks for the assignment**
> - Your submission will not be considered for evaluation

### Autograding
- Every time you push to GitHub, autograding tests will run automatically
- Check the **Actions** tab to see test results
- You'll see a ✅ or ❌ next to your commit

## 📊 Grading

- **Total Points:** 30
- **Sine Tests:** 15 points (1 point per accuracy level)
- **Cosine Tests:** 15 points (1 point per accuracy level)

Your grade will be automatically calculated based on how many tests pass.
## 📝 Submission Guidelines

- Make sure all tests pass before final submission
- Your last commit before the deadline will be graded
- Late submissions may not be accepted
- Ensure your code follows Python best practices

## ❓ Getting Help

If you encounter issues:
1. Check that you're only editing `Q1.py`
2. Make sure your functions have the correct names and parameters
3. Test locally before pushing
4. Review the error messages in the Actions tab
5. Contact your instructor if you need clarification

## 🔒 Academic Integrity

- This is an individual assignment
- Do not share your solution with others
- Do not copy code from external sources
- **Modifying test files is considered academic misconduct**

**Good luck! 🎓**

*Remember: Only edit `Q1.py` - leave all other files unchanged!*
